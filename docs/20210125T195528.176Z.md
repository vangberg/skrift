# Futureproof notes

I expect to work with my Zettelkasten notes for decades to come. Realistically I do not expect Skrift to be around for that long. With that in mind, I want my notes to be truly futureproof and tool independent.

This is achieved by storing notes as plaintext Markdown, without using any app specific extensions.

# Traversing a network of notes

When you take a [#](20210125T195313.813Z.md)-approach to your notes, you end up with a densely linked network of notes. It would seem logical that you end up spending much more time reading and browsing your notes, than you do writing them, and as such, your software should help you with this.

Skrift achieves this by using a combination of interface patterns:

1. You can open multiple notes at once.

2. You can open notes in multiple columns, known as [#](20210127T104528.015Z.md).

3. You can arrange your notes in multiple Workspaces (see [#](20210108T145120.408Z.md))

This enables a number of workflows:

1. Write a note in one stream, while "collecting" related content in other streams.

2. Dive into a subject by zooming into the note, without losing your current context.

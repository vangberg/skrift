# Zettelkasten

Zettelkasten (German for "slip-box") is a method of organizing notes to maximize their future value. Fast (2020) describes it like this:

> A Zettelkasten is a personal tool for thinking and writing. It has hypertextual features to make a web of thought possible. The difference to other systems is that you create a web of thoughts instead of notes of arbitrary size and form, and emphasize connection, not a collection.

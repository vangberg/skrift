# Tool-independent notes

Since notes in Skrift are stored in plaintext Markdown on disk, you can easily use other tools to manipulate or view the same notes.

As an example, you might want to export your notes as a website. This is easily done using any off-the-shelf static site generator, without the need to do any plumbing.
